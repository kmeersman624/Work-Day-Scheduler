# Work-Day-Scheduler
## Description

This is a work day scheduler that can be used to add in events/appointments for each hour of the workday, 9am-5pm. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It also features a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Usage

upon opening the scheduler, todays's date automatically populates.  As you scroll down, you can see that it hastime blocks listed for standard business hours.  The time blocks are color coded based on hours that have passed (grey), current hour (red), and future hours (green).  Click on a time block to enter in your event for that particular time.  Once done, click the save button. Continue entering and saving for all events/appointments for the day.  If you close and open back up, your events will be saved and listed for you.
